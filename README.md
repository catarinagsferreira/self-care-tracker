# Self-care Tracker (GitHub Pages)

This is a simple static site (HTML/CSS/JS) designed to demo:
- A self-care weekly tracker (saved in your browser)
- Editable morning/night routines + goals + playlist (also saved locally)
- A motivational quote card at the top with a **button** that shows a new random quote

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `self-care-tracker`)
2. Upload these files to the repo root:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `app.js`
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**
4. Under **Build and deployment**, select:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/(root)**
5. Save → GitHub will give you a public URL

Tip: Every small change can be a commit:
- “Add quote refresh button”
- “Change the palette”
- “Add a new habit”
